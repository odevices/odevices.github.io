The ER-301 is a voltage-controllable canvas for digital signal processing algorithms.  One of the many characteristics that attracted me to modular synthesizers is that they enabled me to make the kind of music that I love away from the computer.  However, not all digital audio tools can be elegantly and efficiently realized in a dedicated hardware form.  So, I either had to deny myself those tools, or, go to the computer.

### :warning: Read this before you purchase :warning:
* Firmware is still under heavy development which means frequent updates and bugs.  The good news is that typically any bugs found are fixed within a few days.
* No traditional manual.  There is a wiki with lots of documentation but it falls quickly behind development.  The forum is usually the best place to get answers these days.
* All 4 outputs are AC-coupled, therefore, no CV output.
