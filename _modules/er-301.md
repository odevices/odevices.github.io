The ER-301 is a voltage-controllable canvas for digital signal processing algorithms.  One of the many characteristics that attracted me to modular synthesizers is that they enabled me to make the kind of music that I love away from the computer.  However, not all digital audio tools can be elegantly and efficiently realized in a dedicated hardware form.  So, I either had to deny myself those tools, or, go to the computer.
