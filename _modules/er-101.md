The ER-101 is a real-time composition, sequencing and automation environment, all in 26HP. It enables you to compose sequences of thousands of steps with variable duration, variable gate length, arbitrary scales, smooth transitions, save/recall device state and much more. 

### Highlights
* 4-track sequencer
* stepped and smooth voltage transitions
* each track has 3 outputs: 2 CVs + 1 gate
* each track has its own adjustable loop points 
* each track contains up to 100 patterns  and each pattern can contain up to 100 steps
* each step can be individually adjusted to have 0-99 clock cycles in duration
* each gate can be individually adjusted to have 0-99 clock cycles in duration with or without ratcheting
* configure each track to output gates or triggers 
* configure each track to have its own clock multiplier (1x to 99x)
* CVs are chosen (indexed) from voltage tables of which there are 2 per track (A & B)
* 8 built-in and 8 user reference voltage tables for initializing the track tables
* voltage tables are user-editable and have 100 entries per table
* voltages between 0.000-8.192V at 2mV increments can be dialed in 
* each voltage table can be configured to use note display or numeric display
* smoothing can be enabled for individual steps, entire patterns and/or entire tracks 
* smoothed transitions are NOT simply slews but are adjusted to match the current tempo in real-time
* hold feature (complete double-buffering of device state) allows you to edit-and-commit on the beat while the sequencer is running 
* while in hold mode, committing changes to a running sequence can be either immediate or quantized to the beat
* reset can be either immediate or quantized to coincide to with the ending of the current track, pattern, or step
* stores up to 16 snapshots of the state of the entire device
* arbitrary insert/delete of patterns/steps with clipboard style copy/paste 
* math button allows you to specify a mathematical operation to apply to a step, a pattern or a track.
* note repeat (aka ratchet) any step
* shuffle (aka swing) any step
* expansion port 
* last saved snapshot is loaded automatically on power-up
* firmware upgradeable via USB
* expander available: [ER-102]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _modules/er-102.md %})

### Specifications
* Width: 26hp 
* Depth: 30mm from the back of the faceplate including the ribbon cable
* Current Consumption: 
(There is a switch on the back that lets you choose the +5V source.)
  * If +5V source is internal REGulator then approx 120mA from +12V.
  * If +5V source is the BUS then approx 95mA from +5V and 25mA from +12V.
