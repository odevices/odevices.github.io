The ER-301 is a voltage-controllable canvas for digital signal processing algorithms.  One of the many characteristics that attracted me to modular synthesizers is that they enabled me to make the kind of music that I love away from the computer.  However, not all digital audio tools can be elegantly and efficiently realized in a dedicated hardware form.  So, I either had to deny myself those tools, or, go to the computer. 

### Highlights
* Live virtual patch creation without stopping the audio.
* A core library of patchable units covering various functions from the simple (mixing, VCA, envelope generation, limiting, etc.) to the complex (granular synthesis, variable-rate sample playback, wavetable oscillator, etc.)
* Package Manager for easy sharing of patches, presets, and custom units.
* There is a growing collection of user-developed units.
* The firmware and SDK are open-sourced on GitHub.  Users can develop their own units using the mid-level (Lua) SDK for maximum patching flexibility, or, using the low-level (C++) SDK for additional performance and custom graphics.
* 2 monochrome OLED displays where the smaller display shows additional context for the focused element in the main display.
* The main knob is a high-quality optical encoder rated to over 1 million rotations.
* 4x audio (AC-coupled) outputs configurable to 48kHz or 96kHz at 24-bit.
* 4x audio (DC-coupled) inputs sampled up to 60kHz at 16-bit depth.
* 12x CV (DC-coupled) inputs sampled up to 60kHz at 16-bit depth.
* 4x gate (DC-coupled) inputs sampled up to 96kHz at 12-bit depth.

### Specifications
* Width: 30hp 
* Depth: 35mm from the back of the faceplate including the ribbon cable
* [Current Consumption](http://wiki.orthogonaldevices.com/index.php/ER-301/Power): (+12V/-12V/+5V) 250mA/30mA/0mA

### :warning: Read this before you purchase :warning:
* Firmware is still under heavy development which means frequent updates and bugs.  The good news is that typically any bugs found are fixed within a few days.
* The documentation is always lagging behind the firmware development.  The forum is usually the best place to get answers these days.
* All 4 outputs are AC-coupled, therefore, no CV output.  (Gasp!  The horror!)  This is a purposeful design decision to focus the ER-301 on sound generation.  If you think even 10-minutes about what a modulation computer would look like, I think you would agree that it is not the ER-301. :wink:
